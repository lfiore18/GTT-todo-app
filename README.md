# Gateway to Tech practice: TODO app


I'll be expanding this readme as and when I get the time! 


For now, please follow these basic instructions when contributing to the repo:
### 1) Always branch away from main before you start working on a feature.
  If you're using the command line, do the following:
  <code>git checkout -b \<your-branch-name\> </code>
  
### 2) Try to give your branch a name that is both meanginful and concise!
  Where I work, we follow this basic naming convention:  
  
  **"Feature/\<name of branch\>"** - When we want to add a new feature to the project
  
  **"Amend/\<name of branch\>"**   - When we want to fix or refactor an existing feature in the project  
  
  **"Hotfix/\<name of branch\>"**  - When we notice a bug and want to implement a quick/dirty fix for it, buying time until we can implement a real solution  
  
  
  For example, let's say you're adding a button to the TODO app that deletes a todo item, a meaningful name might be "Feature/Add-Delete-Button" or "Feature/Delete-Button"

  
### 3) Once you've finished with your feature, push it to up to this repo and create a pull request.
  
  We can review the changes together as a team, comment on them and request changes (if necessary). It'll go a long way toward giving you the experience of what it's actually like to develop in a professional setting!
